In this 2 hour workshop we will offer two forms of image classification using deep learning. One will be using the Microsoft Custom Vision service and transfer learning, and the other will be using the Microsoft Azure Notebooks and the deep learning API, Keras. 

Both exercises will show you, step-by-step, how to classify clothing into categories such as dresses, t-shirts, sandals, trainers etc. The dataset we will use will be the Fashion MNIST dataset from Zalando the online fashion brand: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

## Microsoft Custom Vision for Image Classification

1. Download and unzip the 'dataset.zip' file from GitHub *(should take around 10 secs)*. 
    * Select the dataset folder and choose the download button
    ![download data](./images/download.JPG "download data")
    * Or download the whole repository from the Readme page
    ![download folder](./images/downloadfolder.JPG "download folder")
    * This contains two folders: train and test data. Look in the folder and view the images
    ![Training Images](./images/images.JPG "Training Images")
2. Visit [www.customvision.ai](http://www.customvision.ai/) and click 'Sign In'
    * Enter your Microsoft Account email and password
    * accept the permissions ask window
    ![permissions](./images/permissions.JPG "permissions")
    * Continue with the trial account
    ![trial account](./images/trialmode.JPG "trial account")
    * now you should see a portal like below
    ![portal](./images/portal.JPG "portal")

3. Create a new project
    * Select new project and complete the fields as shown below
    ![Create new project](./images/createnewproject.JPG "Create new project")
        * Name: name of project
        * Description: description of project
        * Project Types: Classification
        * Classification Types: Multiclass (single tag per image)
        * Domains: Retail
    * Finally click create project and you should see the below
    ![Get Started](./images/getstarted.JPG "Get Started")
 
4. Now lets add training images and classes to our model
    * Click Add Images in the top left
    ![Add Images](./images/addimages.JPG "Add Images")
    * From the 'train' folder of images, every image is prefixed with a label number. For example: 0label_image1.png - this means label/class/category 0 and image 1. There are 0-9 classes for this model and 25 training images per class. Select all the images for class 0 and choose open
    ![Select Images](./images/selectimages.JPG "Select Images")
    * On the upload screen, review the images and in the 'My Tags' box type 'tshirt' and hit enter.
    * Once the 'tshirt' tag turns blue, select 'upload 25 files'
    ![Upload](./images/upload.JPG "Upload")
    * Now you should see your images added to the environment for one class which is labelled on the left
    ![One Class Added](./images/oneclassadded.JPG "One Class Added")

5. Now complete Step 4 for the other 9 classes. Find below the corresponding label number to label text:

| Label Number      | Label Text  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 0      | tshirt |
| 1      | trouser |
| 2      | jumper |
| 3      | dress |
| 4      | coat |
| 5      | sandal |
| 6      | shirt |
| 7      | trainers |
| 8      | bag |
| 9      | boots |


* Select images from each category to upload
* Add the correct tag to each class
* Complete this for classes 0-9
![All Classes Added](./images/allclasses.JPG "All Classes Added")

6. Once all images are uploaded you are ready to train the model. In the top right corner click 'Train'
![train](./images/train.JPG "train")

7. After training you will be take to the 'Performance' tab where you will see summary statistics of the trained model you created - its not too bad!
![performance](./images/performance.JPG "performance")
    * You can also review the performance metrics by category
    ![performance by category](./images/perfbycategory.JPG "performance by category")

8. Now to test the model on new images
    * We can test the model quickly in the UI.
    * In the top right click 'Quick Test'
    ![quick test](./images/quicktest.JPG "quick test")
    * choose browse for files and select an image from the 'test' folder. Click open and view the models evaluation of this image.
    ![test](./images/test.JPG "test")
    


These images are 28 x 28 pixel images and so are very small. Therefore we will try another way of testing the model using an Azure Notebook.

Notebook editors are often using in Machine Learning.

## Azure Notebooks for Image Classification

1. Browse to [https://notebooks.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-amynic](https://notebooks.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-amynic)

# Remember to delete your resources

The custom vision service and Azure notebooks are currently free to use. You do not need to delete or shut down these items

For the Data Science VM, make sure you either:

* **Delete the VM:** remove the resource from your subscription and lose your work by deleting
![delete](./images/delete.JPG "delete") 
* **Shutdown the VM:** keep the VM setup and work but shut down the machine. This stops the cost of compute resources but you still pay for the storage of the VM
![shutdown](./images/stop.JPG "shutdown")
